# Calculator-Project

This project is an on-screen calculator built to strengthen my understanding of HTML and CSS, with a primary focus on JavaScript functionality.

## Features

1.  Basic Arithmetic Operations:
    Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers.
2.  Chained Calculations:
    When a new operator is pressed after a calculation, the previous result is used as the first number in the next operation.
3.  Responsive On-Screen Buttons
    Digit and operator buttons update the display dynamically on click.
4.  Clear Function
    The "CLEAR" button resets the calculator completely, wiping out all stored values and display content.
5.  Backspace Function
    The "DELETE" button removes the last digit entered on the screen, allowing corrections without starting over.
6.  Equals Functionality (=)
    Computes the result when two operands and an operator are provided.
7.  Decimal Support
    The calculator allows decimal input and ensures no more than one decimal is added per number.
8.  Division by Zero Handling
    Displays a friendly "SYNTAX ERROR" message if division by zero is attempted.
9.  Smart Input Handling
    Prevents multiple operators from being entered consecutively and resets the input field cleanly after a result is shown.
